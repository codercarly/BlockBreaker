# BlockBreaker
This version of a block breaker game was designed within Scene Builder and programmed using JavaFX.

The text book assignment builds off bouncing-ball animation techniques to create an interactive game with a bouncing ball, rows and columns of blocks, and a paddle. The game begins with the ball sitting on the paddle and the user presses the space bar to start. The paddle is controlled by the left and right arrow keys.

# Goals
- Keep the ball and paddle within the pane
- Working collisions between the ball/paddle and ball/bricks
- Successfully remove the bricks when the ball collides
- Remove lives if the ball hits the bottom of the pane
- The user wins if they remove all of the bricks before losing all of their lives
